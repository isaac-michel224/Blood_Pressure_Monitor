# Blood_Pressure_Monitor

The program allows users to track their daily Blood Pressure and upload to a system where they can track it and also allows a second party (i.e. healthcare provider, physician, etc.) to keep track as well.  

This system includes a calendar that allows the user to input and track their daily blood pressure readings.
